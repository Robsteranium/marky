# Marky! The Collaborative Markdown Editor

All I really want is Google Docs to support Markdown, is that too much to ask? Yes? All right then, I guess we'll have to settle for [Marky](http://mbleigh.github.com/marky).

Marky is a simple Javascript app wrapper around the widely known [Etherpad](http://etherpad.org) that lets you write collaborative, live-previewed Markdown documents with your friends.

Marky works well with code fences and other GitHub flavored markdown (thanks to the Marked library).
